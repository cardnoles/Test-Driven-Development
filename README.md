# Test-Driven-Development

###History

Timeline:

* 1976 - publication of "software reliability" by Glenford Myers states a developer should never test their own code.
* 1990 - black box techniques dominate (in black box testing, the tester does not know how the code works, only what it               should be doing in the end).
* 1994 - Kent Beck writes SUnit testing framework for Smalltalk
* 1998 - Extreme Programming article about writing the test first
* 1998 - 2002 Test first becomes Test Driven
* 2003 - Kent Beck's "Test Driven Development: By Example" is published
* 2006 - Test Driven Development is considered a relatively mature discipline



###Test Driven Development Basics

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a style of programming with 3 primary activities:
1) Coding
2) Testing
3) Refactoring.
BUT ... they are not done in that order.

The key steps are:
1) write the test
2) run the test - make sure that it fails.  It is important that the test fails.
3) write just enough code to pass the test
4) run the test - hopefully it will pass
5) refactor the code if needed
6) repeat the process.
The cycle is very quick - each iteration should not take more than a couple of minutes.

This is referred to as a Red, Green, Refactor cycle.  Each cycle moves the code forward just a bit.  One advantage
of this is that you are never very far away from passing code.  Studies have shown that it is a more efficient and more accurate way to develop software.

TDD is often used in an Agile Software Development environment.
